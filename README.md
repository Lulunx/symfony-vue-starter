## Installing the project

$ yarn install #recommended
or

Compile js and css files

```

Execute built in Symfony web server

```
It will start a server accessible at http://localhost:8080

or

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

Server will be accessible at http://localhost:8888 and Redis cach√© will
be available


## Vue development

Vue files are located at /assets/js folder. Just modify these files as a regular Vue project.

I suggest you using hot-reload encore server. When a file is updated webpack will be launched automatically. Start it with this command

```sh
$ ./node_modules/.bin/encore dev --watch
```

Files app.js and app.css will be compiled at /public/build folder.

Default controller contains just one root route that renders this necessary files.

SassLoader is activated, so all changes on /assets/js/app.scss will be compiled too.

Axios are prototyped as $http. This service will be available at the whole Vue app.

Vuex and Vue-router are included too. Be free to add as routes and stores as you want.
